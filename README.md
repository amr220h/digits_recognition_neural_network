Project Description
In this project, I built two models for image classification:

ANN model (Artificial Neural Network) by flattening the images and processing them through Dense layers.

CNN model (Convolutional Neural Network) to automatically extract features from images using Convolution and MaxPooling layers.

Keras was used to design and train both models, applying activation functions like ReLU and Softmax, and using the Adam optimizer to improve performance.
